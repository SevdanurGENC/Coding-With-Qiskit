# Coding-With-Qiskit

In this repo, the use of the qiskit framework is included as a starter for quantum programming.


# Qiskit basics

- A quantum circuit with more quantum bits

## Qiskit Reference

- Creating a quantum circuit
- One qubit gates
- Two-qubit gates
- Three-qubit gate
- Measuring a quantum circuit
- Quantum operation controlled by a classical register
- Drawing or printing a quantum circuit
- Executing a quantum program on local simulator
- Reading the quantum state of a circuit on local simulator
- Reading the unitary operator of a circuit on local simulator
